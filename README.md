# HPCC
Modularized NLP engine that runs on HPCC (Java, HPCC, Natural Language Processing)

1.Broke GATE, the popular but linear monolithic pipeline, down to basic PRs (processing resource)
2.Built an engine that enables individual PR runs, caching preceding PR results, and re-branching PRs, which collectively made it a more flexible and powerful NLP engine
3. Implemented the engine in ECL â€“ giving it the power of parallel processing from HPCC
